            <p>As you can see at the top of the page, my name is Kristen. I am looking to change my career, and my life! I received a B.A. in Studio Art but ended up in the insurance field--not even remotely my passion. After many years, I decided to pursue other avenues. I finally ended up here, coding!</p>
            <p>I love pets. I used to have 2 siberian huskies, Maple and Kai. I now have a black cat named Felix. I plan to add a dog or two in the next year.</p>
            <p>I have lived in 5 states--Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Ohio. I have visited 3 countries--Canada, England, and the Netherlands. I hope to add many more countries to that list.</p>
